    "about":"I am programmer with a master's degree in the physics. I learn the programming about the four years ago as an hobby because i am so free and i can learn it using free sources like youtube and its documentations. I learn multiple languages and frameworks by myself just as an hobby. But i fall into the ocean of programming and it become my passion. Now I wanted to turn my passion into my job.",

And then you are ready to share the file of a selected folder to the other client/devices having a web browser, and they can access the content in the folder with there login credentials with encryption and security of the deployed system. The best of this project is that it not need a database for store files it utilize the filesystem for storing the file and accessing the file so it doesn't affect the deployed device and it useable while it share files with other devices and clients. It is written in the Python using Flask framework which is very lightweight and using nginx as the http-server with the using the benefits Multiprocessing for handling multiple concurrent users and also using multi threading to handle the IO jobs. It will allow user to download and upload file from the server/deployed device and it doesn't allow user to delete files for a security of the files and only admin having physical access to computer can delete files. And it stores the all version of the files that being modified to allow admin to finalize the version of the files.",

It uses nginx as the http-server which run flask app with multiprocessing to handle concurrent clients and it also use multithreading for IO and today filesystem can enable to access the same file to multiple processes without any data corruption. It also using SSL encryption for security. It also user access log for blame. And it use a internal variable server like redis to store the parser key and session key and user data that using the service in present. All the request are send using a parser key which unique to every request and checked on every request and uses to validate user and by decoding it giving a actual request, and it ensure the request is not made by any middle man.",
